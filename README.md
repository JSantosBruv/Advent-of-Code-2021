# Advent-of-Code-2021 in Go

## Project structure divided by days. Each day contains four files:
* part1.go - Go file for part 1 of the day challenge
* part2.go - Go file for part 2 of the day challenge
* main.go -  Go file to run both solutions
* input.txt - Puzzle input file.

## Please feel free to open Issues and discuss any bugs found. 

PS: Project structure might be a little weird, still getting used to Go's project structure.
